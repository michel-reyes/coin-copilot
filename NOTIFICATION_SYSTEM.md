# Notification System Implementation

## Overview

A complete recurring notification system has been implemented for Coin Copilot. The system allows users to create reminders for bills, credit cards, and budget reviews with customizable notification schedules (e.g., "3 days before at 9 AM", "on the day at 2 PM").

**Architecture**: Supabase Edge Functions + pg_cron + Expo Push Notifications

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/20251020000000_create_notification_system.sql`)

**Extended `user_api_keys` table**:
- `expo_push_token` - User's Expo push token
- `expo_push_token_updated_at` - When the token was last updated
- `device_info` - Device metadata (platform, name, app version)

**New tables**:
- `events` - Recurring events (bills, credit cards, budget reviews)
- `event_notification_schedules` - Multiple notification times per event
- `notification_queue` - Tracks sent notifications (prevents duplicates, debugging)

**Database features**:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies - Users can only access their own data
- Helper function `should_event_notify_on_date()` - Calculates if event occurs on a date
- Automatic `updated_at` triggers
- Indexes for performance

### 2. Supabase Edge Functions

**`register-push-token`** (`supabase/functions/register-push-token/`)
- Stores user's Expo push token in database
- Called from mobile app after user grants notification permissions
- Validates token format
- Requires user JWT authentication

**`send-scheduled-notifications`** (`supabase/functions/send-scheduled-notifications/`)
- Main notification processor (runs on cron schedule)
- Finds events with notifications due in next hour
- Sends push notifications via Expo Push API
- Logs results to `notification_queue` table
- Handles deduplication (won't send same notification twice)
- Clears invalid/expired tokens automatically

**Shared utilities**:
- `expo-push-client.ts` - Expo Push API integration with batching support
- `notification-calculator.ts` - Recurrence calculation logic
- `cors.ts` - CORS headers for functions

### 3. Mobile App Updates

**Updated `useNotifications` hook** (`src/app/hooks/useNotifications.ts`)
- Registers push token in database after getting it from Expo
- Sends device info (platform, device name, app version)

**New API utility** (`src/app/lib/eventsApi.ts`)
- `getEvents()` - Fetch user's events
- `getEventById()` - Fetch single event with schedules
- `createEvent()` - Create event with notification schedules
- `updateEvent()` - Update event details
- `deleteEvent()` - Soft delete event
- `addNotificationSchedule()` - Add notification time
- Helper functions for formatting and descriptions

**New screens**:
- `/events/index.tsx` - Events list view with pull-to-refresh
- `/events/create.tsx` - Event creation form with full UI
- `/events/[id].tsx` - Event detail view

**UI Features**:
- Event type selector (Bill, Credit Card, Budget Review)
- Date picker for due date
- Recurrence picker (Monthly, Weekly, Custom, One-time)
- Multiple notification schedules per event
- Time picker for each notification
- "Days before" selector (0 = on the day, 1+ = days before)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
# Install DateTimePicker for the create/edit screens
npx expo install @react-native-community/datetimepicker
```

### 2. Apply Database Migration

```bash
# Push migration to Supabase
npm run db:push

# Verify migration was applied
npm run db:status
```

### 3. Deploy Edge Functions

```bash
# Make sure Supabase CLI is installed and you're logged in
supabase login

# Link to your project (if not already linked)
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Deploy all functions
supabase functions deploy

# Or deploy individually
supabase functions deploy register-push-token
supabase functions deploy send-scheduled-notifications
```

### 4. Set Up Cron Job

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Database** → **Cron Jobs**
3. Click **Create a new cron job**
4. Configure:
   - Name: `send-scheduled-notifications`
   - Schedule: `0 * * * *` (every hour) or `*/15 * * * *` (every 15 min)
   - Type: Supabase Edge Function
   - Function: `send-scheduled-notifications`
   - Method: POST
5. Click **Create**

**Option B: SQL Command**
```sql
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'send-scheduled-notifications',
  '0 * * * *',
  $$
  SELECT net.http_post(
    url := 'https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-scheduled-notifications',
    headers := jsonb_build_object(
      'Authorization', 'Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY',
      'Content-Type', 'application/json'
    )
  ) AS request_id;
  $$
);
```

### 5. Add Events Route to Navigation (Optional)

Update your root layout or navigation to include a link to the events screen:

```typescript
// In your navigation or home screen
<Link href="/events">Reminders</Link>
```

## Testing

### 1. Test Push Token Registration

1. Run the app on a physical device
2. Sign in with your account
3. Check the database:
```sql
SELECT user_id, expo_push_token, device_info
FROM user_api_keys
WHERE expo_push_token IS NOT NULL;
```

### 2. Create Test Events

1. Navigate to `/events/create` in the app
2. Create a test event:
   - Type: Bill
   - Title: "Test Reminder"
   - Due date: Today
   - Recurrence: One time
   - Notification: 0 days before at current time + 5 minutes
3. Save and verify it appears in the events list

### 3. Test Notification Processing

```bash
# Manually invoke the notification processor
curl -X POST https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-scheduled-notifications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"

# Check notification queue
SELECT * FROM notification_queue ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Verify Cron Job

```sql
-- Check if cron job is scheduled
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'send-scheduled-notifications';

-- View cron job run history
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details
WHERE jobid = (SELECT jobid FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'send-scheduled-notifications')
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

---

## How It Works

### Notification Flow

1. **User creates event** → Stored in `events` table with notification schedules
2. **Cron job runs** (hourly) → Triggers `send-scheduled-notifications` edge function
3. **Edge function calculates** → Which notifications are due in next hour
4. **Deduplication check** → Skips notifications already sent today
5. **Fetch push tokens** → Gets Expo push tokens from `user_api_keys` table
6. **Send via Expo API** → Batches up to 100 notifications per request
7. **Log results** → Saves to `notification_queue` table with status
8. **Handle errors** → Clears invalid tokens, logs failures

### Recurrence Logic

**Monthly**: Fires on same day of each month (e.g., 15th of every month)
**Weekly**: Fires on same day of week (e.g., every Monday)
**Custom**: Fires every N days from due date
**One-time**: Fires only on exact due date

### Notification Scheduling

Each event can have multiple notification times:
- **0 days before at 9:00 AM** = Notification on the event day at 9 AM
- **3 days before at 2:00 PM** = Notification 3 days before event at 2 PM
- **7 days before at 9:00 AM** + **1 day before at 5:00 PM** = Two notifications

## Database Queries (Useful for Debugging)

```sql
-- View all active events
SELECT * FROM events WHERE is_active = true ORDER BY due_date;

-- View events with their notification schedules
SELECT
  e.id,
  e.title,
  e.due_date,
  e.recurrence_type,
  json_agg(
    json_build_object(
      'days_before', ens.days_before,
      'time', ens.notification_time,
      'is_active', ens.is_active
    )
  ) as schedules
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN event_notification_schedules ens ON ens.event_id = e.id
WHERE e.is_active = true
GROUP BY e.id
ORDER BY e.due_date;

-- Check notification queue (sent, pending, failed)
SELECT
  nq.id,
  nq.scheduled_for,
  nq.sent_at,
  nq.status,
  nq.error_message,
  e.title as event_title
FROM notification_queue nq
JOIN events e ON e.id = nq.event_id
ORDER BY nq.created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Count notifications by status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM notification_queue GROUP BY status;

-- Find users without push tokens
SELECT user_id, created_at
FROM user_api_keys
WHERE expo_push_token IS NULL;

-- Clear invalid tokens (if needed)
UPDATE user_api_keys
SET expo_push_token = NULL, expo_push_token_updated_at = NULL
WHERE expo_push_token IS NOT NULL
AND expo_push_token_updated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### View Edge Function Logs

**Supabase Dashboard**:
1. Go to **Edge Functions** in sidebar
2. Click on function name
3. View **Logs** tab

**CLI**:
```bash
supabase functions logs send-scheduled-notifications --tail
```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Notifications not sending
- Check if cron job is running: `SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details ORDER BY start_time DESC;`
- Check if users have push tokens: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_api_keys WHERE expo_push_token IS NOT NULL;`
- Check edge function logs for errors
- Verify events are active: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE is_active = true;`

**Issue**: Duplicate notifications
- The system prevents duplicates using `(user_id, event_id, date)` unique constraint
- Check `notification_queue` for duplicates

**Issue**: Invalid push tokens
- System automatically clears invalid tokens and logs errors
- Users need to re-login to register new token

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Receipt Tracking**: Query Expo receipts API to confirm delivery
2. **User Preferences**: Global notification settings (mute, quiet hours)
3. **Smart Scheduling**: Avoid sending on weekends/holidays
4. **Notification History**: View past notifications in app
5. **Edit Events**: Full edit functionality (currently only create/delete)
6. **Snooze**: Allow users to snooze notifications
7. **Rich Notifications**: Images, action buttons
8. **Analytics**: Track open rates, engagement

---

## Security Notes

- All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Users can only access their own events and schedules
- Edge functions validate authentication
- Service role key is never exposed to client
- Push tokens stored securely in database

---

## Cost Considerations

**Supabase**:
- Edge function invocations: 2M free/month (1 cron per hour = ~720/month)
- Database storage: 500MB free tier
- Realtime/API calls: Covered by free tier for most use cases

**Expo Push Notifications**:
- Completely free, unlimited notifications

**Estimated monthly cost**: $0 for typical usage (within free tiers)
